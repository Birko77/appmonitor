App monitoring page

An intranet page that displays performance data to monitor a social app.

jQuery AJAX calls are used to retrieve data from a web service.

The API takes three input variables:
1. the time frame for the required data (how many days into the past?)
2. if the data should be accumulated or per day
3. if the data should be for the whole country or per state

The web service returns JSON strings with the required data.
